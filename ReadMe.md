# Welcome to my Coursera Projects Repo.

Currently, this repo acts as a way to manage my coding projects across devices and as a way to display all of the cool (To me at least haha) things I am learning.

Within the root directory are the folders for each class I am currently working on.
Check in those folders to see any coding projects within.

## Current Classes:

* Microsoft Back-End Developer (C#, .net, etc)
